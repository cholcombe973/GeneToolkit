   This class should adapt action listeners to global listeners
   The idea is that a module/plug-in shouldn't have to make it's
   own custom ActionListener class but rather just listen for events
   that pertain to it.  This class will be a go between, translating
   ActionEvents to GlobalEvents

   The Module needs to be passed to the adapter to fire events to it.
   Problem: How to get the Module to pass the events back to efficiently
